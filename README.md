Tic Tac Toe Game
A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Description
This project is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game features a clean user interface and includes functionality to determine the winner or declare a draw.

Features
Two-player gameplay: Players can take turns marking spaces as X or O.
Win detection: The game detects when a player has won by aligning three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
Draw detection: If all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
Reset option: Players can reset the game board to start a new game.
Usage
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Click on any empty space in the grid to place your mark. The game will automatically switch turns between players. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed, and you can choose to reset the game board to play again.



Installation
No installation is required to play the game. Simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser.
